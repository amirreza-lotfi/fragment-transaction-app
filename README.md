# fragment-transaction
This is a simple app about Fragment transactions in android . in this app, with FragmentTransaction liberary, you can see how we can :<br />
1- move from a Activity to a Fragment . <br />
2- move from Fragment to another Fragment. <br />
3- use interface to communicate between classes. <br />
4- transfer data from fragment to  another Fragment. <br />

in this project, I did not use <b>DataBinding</b>. In next project, I implement this project with <b>DataBinding</b>. 
# Getting Start
you can be able to open this project right away into Android Studio.
